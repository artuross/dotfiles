# dotfiles

These are my incomplete dotfiles. I use [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) to manage them. Most packages are installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [`mise`](https://github.com/jdx/mise).

## highlights

- [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) is the terminal emulator
- [Nushell](https://kagi.com/search?q=nushell+github) is the main shell
- [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) is the primary editor
