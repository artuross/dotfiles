# dotfiles

These are my incomplete dotfiles. I use `chezmoi` to manage them. Most packages are installed with Homebrew and `mise` (when I care about the version).

## highlights

- Kitty is the terminal emulator
- Nushell is the main shell
- Zed is the primary editor

## what I don't like

I use `chezmoi` scripts, do run certain scripts such as setting macOS defaults. When running `chezmoi diff`, these show up as changes which I don't like. Feel free to drop a suggestion if you know how to improve it.
